    <li><h2>Video Games</h2>
        <p>I enjoy spending my time playing Video Games like Valoarant, or the Total War Series.<br/>
           
            I feel like strategic games like these help in improving our problem solving skills, and teach us how to work and communicate in groups efficiently.

            I also enjoy reading mystery and suspense filled books, as currently I am reading book called The Cage by Lloyd Jones which is about two strangers who are trapped within a cage, <br/>and the mystery is all about who the strangers are, where they came from.<br/>

        <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>There are many sports I love to play, some of which are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Cricket</h3></li>
            <p>I have been playing and following cricket for as long as I can remember, it is the first sport I ever got into.<br/>
                I joined the School Cricket Team in 8th Grade, when I used to be in Westminster, Sharjah, infortunely we didn't have any matches except for once when we played against parents.<br/>
                I also played in a tournament of indoor cricket in my freshmen year of University.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Swimming</h3></li>
            <p>I took swimming lessons when I was around 10, during my summer vacation, and after we moved to the UAE, we had a pool at the top of our apartement where i used to frequently go.<br/>Now a days, i love to swim whenever i get the chance to, whether we are on a beach or at a farmhouse.</p>
            <li><h3>Horse riding</h3></li>
            <p>I took regular horse riding classes in 2019, but due to Covid-19, we had to cancel our membership.</p>
